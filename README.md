This is my AI 2 Course Project - Hampus Nilsson
CNN 48x48 Face Models
Ive trained one expression model on one dataset and three models(age, ethnicity, gender) on another dataset. Age model i decided not to use it in the Home.py webcam prediction.
Application is made into a Streamlit application where the user can decide if they want to detect age and/or gender and/or expression, aswell as pages for model analysis and model prediction tests.
